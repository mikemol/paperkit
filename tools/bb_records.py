"""W44b — read BuildBuddy's EXECUTION RECORDS for one invocation, and count them.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  The execution log is gone (Ζ·execlog·drop): it cost 138 GB and an OOM to write,
and the only fields telemetry ever read — which action ran, where, for how long, with how much
memory and CPU — are already kept by BuildBuddy, per executed action.  This is the one reader of
those records, so the metrics push and any question like "which 18,594 actions re-ran?" read the
same thing instead of each improvising a query over the JSON.

READ, NEVER COPIED.  The endpoint is BuildBuddy's web service by its in-cluster name; the records
are fetched per call and never cached here.  A record this reader cannot interpret is COUNTED as
unreadable rather than dropped, so a total always states how much of the response it covers.

    bb_records.py <invocation-id>            # counts by worker and by command, as JSON
